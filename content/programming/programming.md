I like programming and I dedicate most of my time to it.

I can program in multiple [languages](programming/languages/languages.md) and multiple [markups](programming/markup/markup.md) too

Python is my native language and I know how to use most libraries in Python.

I am also a big fan of [Unix](programming/unix/unix.md). I love Linux and I use Arch BTW.
