# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web-page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

# My experience

JavaScript is a weird language. Did you know it was written in 10 days? Its a crazy language and it has many unnecessary ways to do one simple task and many many frameworks solving many problems that were created by another many frameworks.

Nonetheless I enjoy programming in JavaScript because its very rewarding in a way. Very little code results in a big results. At least that's my experience.
