# What is Lua?

Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.

# My experience

I have mainly worked with Lua back in the days when I used to make games on Roblox. I was using slightly modified version of Lua called Roblox Lua. Outside Roblox I have only written tiny programs for fun.
