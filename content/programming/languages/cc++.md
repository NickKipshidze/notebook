# What is C?

C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.

# What is C++?

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.

# My experience

C is a very nice language. I had a lot of fun with C alongside OpenGL. In my opinion C is not practical. Its very fun and easy to create little projects but Its too hard or heavyweight to make any real projects.

C++ on the other hand is good too. I like object oriented programming.

### I know how to use C/C++ frameworks:

- [OpenGL](programming/frameworks/opengl.md)
- [Ncurses](programming/frameworks/ncurses.md)
