# What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.

# My experience

I love using Python and I have written many projects with it. I have writing style where I give type hints to almost everything and write clear and readable code.

- [NumPy](programming/frameworks/numpy.md)
- [Tensorflow](programming/frameworks/tensorflow.md)
- [Pandas](programming/frameworks/pandas.md)
